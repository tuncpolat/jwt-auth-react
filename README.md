# User Authentification and Authorization with JWT (Access and Refresh Token) in React

This is the React front-end part to demonstrate JWT authorization and authentication inspired by this [blogpost by Hasura](https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/).<br/> You must also install and run the server. Check it out [here](https://github.com/tuncpolat/jwt-auth-react). In my blog post I try to explain how the whole JWT authentication and authorization flow with access and refresh tokens works in a MERN Stack. You can read it [here](https://simplweb.ch/en/blog/user-authentification-and-authorization-with-jwt-access-and-refresh-token-in-nodejs-react-express-and-mongo-db)

## Back-End

To use this is properly you have to clone and run the server. Check it out [here](https://github.com/tuncpolat/jwt-auth-react)

## Setup & Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

After you clone this repo to your desktop, go to its root directory and run `npm install` to install its dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `npm start` to start the application. Be sure that the server is also running on port 5000.
